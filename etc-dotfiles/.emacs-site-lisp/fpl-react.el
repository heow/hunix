(defvar fpl-react-processes nil
  "*This variable specifies which processes and network connections that
fpl-react-spawn can spawn.  Add your entries to this list, but do not add them
in the source to this package, because you'll lose your changes when you
upgrade to a new version of this package.  Instead, append or prepend your
entries to this list in your .emacs startup file (if you are an end user) or
in your package's initialization phase (if you are authoring a package that
uses this one).

This variable's value is a list, each element of which is a list of the form

	(ID TYPE FILTER BUFFERNAME SPAWNINFO)

ID is a string that names the process.  Pass this string to fpl-react-spawn
to spawn this process or this network connection.  If you have more than one
entry with the same name, all but the first is ignored.  The name of the
process buffer is derived from ID but is not the same as ID.  When
fpl-react-spawn is invoked interactively, you can enter this string in the
minibuffer.

TYPE is a symbol that specifies the kind of process to create.  The symbol
conn means to open a TCP/IP connection to a given port on a given host (via
open-network-stream), and proc means to spawn a child process (via
start-process) which runs a given program.  Once spawned, input can be sent to
the process/connection via process-send-string.

FILTER is a function or nil.  FILTER is a user-supplied function that is used
to filter the output in any fashion the user wishes.  If nil, no user filter
function is called, and the process output is inserted directly in the process
buffer.  FILTER is _not_ installed as the actual filter function (via
set-process-filter) for the process.  Instead, the actual filter function,
which is defined by this package, calls FILTER, passing it two arguments: a
process object and a string containing some output from that process.

FILTER is called before the output is scanned for regular expressions (i.e.,
before any autoreactions take place) and with the process mark positioned
immediately after the last output inserted in the buffer (this is an invariant
that FILTER _must_ maintain).  FILTER is called with the process buffer as the
current buffer.  FILTER is free to modify the process buffer, but it should
not expect point or mark to be in any given locations, and it should respect
the fact that the user may be typing into the process buffer at that moment.

If FILTER returns a string, that string is used in place of the original output
of the process for all further processsing, including autoreaction processing
(see the function fpl-react-register).  The string is inserted in the buffer at
the process mark, and the process mark is advanced.  If a non-string object is
returned (e.g., nil, t, 99), no further processing of the output occurs,
including autoreaction processing, and nothing is inserted into the buffer.

BUFFERNAME is either nil or a string naming the buffer to be created for the
process or network connection.  If nil, the name of the buffer will be ID.
At buffer-creation time, if the desired name is already in use, a unique name
is generated via generate-new-buffer-name.

SPAWNINFO is a list that specifies how to spawn the process or network
connection.  If TYPE is conn, then SPAWNINFO is either (HOST PORTNUM) or
(HOST SERVICE).  HOST is the Internet hostname to connect to.  PORTNUM is the
port number to connect to.  SERVICE is a string specifying the name of the
service to connect to.  If TYPE is proc, then SPAWNINFO is a list of strings.
The first element is a command to spawn, and the remaining elements are
argument strings (which can be omitted if the command takes no arguments).
The command is _not_ fed to a shell first, but a relative filename is searched
for in the directories listed in the variable exec-path.")

(defun fpl-react-register (id regexp form &optional replace replace-all)
  "Register an autoreaction form as associated with ID, a string.  When a line
of output from a process or network connection spawned by passing ID to
fpl-react-spawn matches REGEXP, evaluate FORM.  If FORM is a symbol bound as a
function, that function will be called with no arguments instead of merely
evaluating the symbol.  If the optional argument REPLACE is non-nil, then the
most recently registered autoreaction for ID that has the same REGEXP is
deregistered prior to registering the new one.  If the optional argument
REPLACE-ALL is non-nil, then all autoreactions for ID having the same REGEXP are
deregistered prior to registering the new one.

ID is a string that was (or will be) passed to fpl-react-spawn.  Note: if you
register your autoreaction forms after calling fpl-react-spawn, there might not
be enough time to register all of them before the process emits output that
you want to react to.  Note that ID's autoreactions remain registered until
explicitly deregistered by fpl-react-deregister or implicitly deregistered by
fpl-react-register.  Killing the process or the process buffer does not change
what autoreactions are registered to a given ID.

FORM is evaluated at most once per line of output.  If REGEXP matches more
than one string on a line, only the first match causes FORM to be evaluated.
REGEXP is only matched against individual lines of output.  REGEXP does not
match across newlines.  More than one autoreaction can be registered for a
given ID with the same REGEXP.

FORM is evaluated with the current buffer set to the buffer associated with
ID and with the symbols \"start\" and \"end\" bound to markers marking
the starting and ending buffer positions of the text that matched REGEXP.
Point is wherever the client of this package (a person or another package)
left it when FORM began evaluation.  FORM is free to alter the buffer in any
way it wants -- this package is policy-free in that regard.  But beware that
the user may be in the midst of typing input into the buffer, so modifying the
location of point or mark or which buffer is current may interfere with the
user's activity.

FORM is evaluated with \"fpl-react-sym\" bound to an uninterned symbol.  The
uninterned symbol's variable and function bindings are initially void, and its
property list is initially nil.  Each time FORM is evaluated, \"fpl-react-sym\"
will be bound to the same uninterned symbol, which will not be altered in any
way by this package -- or any other package, since it's uninterned.  The
uninterned symbol is a place for FORM to save state between evaluations.  If
you wish to avoid frequent use of

	(eval fpl-react-sym)

to retrieve the value of the uninterned symbol, use \"get\" and \"put\" to
store and access values in properties on the symbol as follows:

	(put fpl-react-sym 'counter 99)
	(message \"The counter is now %d\" (get fpl-react-sym 'counter))

This has the added benefit of allowing an arbitrary number of values to be
stored."
