### Highlights of Heow's Unix

* find-known-hosts.sh - searches for known hosts on the local network by MAC address.  If found, hosts are added or updated in ~/.ssh/config, making them accessable by ssh.
* e - instant launching emacs, using emacs-server
* secure-backup-remote.sh - find, encrypt, compress and back up directory tree over the network.  Supports file exclusions.
* clj - run Clojure locally or via lien if you're in a project directory.

...and many more.
