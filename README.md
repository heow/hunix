### Highlights of Heow's Unix ###

This is the collections of scripts and things that I've hacked together throughout my career to make life easier in a Unix-like environment.

You know you're doing things right when your scripts keep getting imported into software as features, I expect you'll find something here you like.

* secure-backup-remote.sh - find, encrypt, compress and back up directory tree over the network.  Supports file exclusions, uses GPG for encryption and SSH for transport.  Files are future proof.

...and many more.

### Getting Started

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heow/hunix/master/bin/get-hunix.sh)
```
